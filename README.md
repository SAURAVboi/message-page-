# Message Page

**Message Page** is a simple web-based contact form designed to allow users to send messages directly to an admin. Users can enter their name, email, and a custom message, then click "Send" to submit their message. The form collects the input and automatically emails it to the designated admin email address, making it easy for administrators to contact users for follow-up.

## Features:
- **User Input Fields**: Collects the user's name, email, and message.
- **Email Integration**: Sends user messages directly to the admin's email.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Tech Stack:
- **HTML**: For structuring the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the form and page layout.
- **JavaScript**: For handling form submissions.

### How it Works:
1. User fills out the form with their name, email, and message.
2. Upon clicking "Send," the message is sent to the admin's email for further communication.
3. Admin receives the email and can respond directly to the user.
